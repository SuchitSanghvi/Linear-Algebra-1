# Linear-Algebra

In the given code matrix is rigid:- 

matrix [ 1 0 0 0 0;
         0 1 0 0 0;
         0 0 1 2 3;
         0 0 0 1 4;
         0 0 5 6 0; ]
        
 you can see the output by simulating 
 
 ->Above code only works when the output is integer while simulating the inverse of the matrix.
